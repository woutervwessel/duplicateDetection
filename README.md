# duplicateDetection

In this project we have developed a method to find duplicate products across different stores. 
We use a data set containing data on TVs offered by four different online shops. 

In order to effectively find duplicates, we implement Local Sensitivity Hashing to reduce the number of product pairs that have to be evaluated, which we then compare with a simple single component similarity measure.

The method is based on Hartveld et al. (2018) and a full explanation can be found in Van Wessel (2021).
